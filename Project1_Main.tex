\section{Introduction}

Random numbers have a long history. In the acient world, dices are the most popular instrument to generate them that the oldest dices were discovered in a 24th century B.C. tomb in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the crack of heated turtle shell was regarded as another random number in ancient China. Nowadays, Lottery machines are typical random number generators.

All mentioned above are true random numbers, which are taken from physical factors. In this way people can get perfect distributed random numbers. However, as people's need for random number increases, the disadvantages of true ones become obvious. They need extra hardwares and the generating speed is relatively slow since numbers should be taken from hardware values. Moreover, they are surely not reproducible. 

For disadvantages above, the idea of pseudorandom numbers are promoted. They are produced with a pseudorandom number generator(PRNG), which is a kind of algorithm. If a random number as a seed is input, a generator can produce a sequence of numbers that can be nearly seen as random ones.
